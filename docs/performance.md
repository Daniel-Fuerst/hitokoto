# Performance

Budgets come from the brief, section 4. They are checked by two tools:

- `hitokoto_core_bench` (Google Benchmark): core costs for 10 MB files and theme parsing.
- `hitokoto-bench`: end to end. Cold start (separate processes, time from exec to the first painted
  frame with the file shown), opening 1 MB and 10 MB files, key-to-paint latency while typing,
  pressing Enter and moving across headings, and saving 10 MB.

```sh
cmake --preset bench && cmake --build --preset bench
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen build/bench/bench/hitokoto-bench --runs 10 --output results.json
build/bench/bench/hitokoto-bench --fail-on-budget   # on a reference machine, with a real display
```

CI runs both on Linux, Windows and macOS and compares with `bench/baselines/<os>.json`
(tolerance 25 %, differences under 2 ms ignored). See `bench/baselines/README.md`.

## Measurements

### 2026-10-24, development VM (not reference hardware)

Cloud VM, 2 vCPU x86-64, 7 GiB RAM, no GPU, Ubuntu 24.04, Qt 6.12.0, release build,
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` unless noted. Indicative only; S011 measures on real machines.

| Measurement | Result | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Cold start, exec to first frame (offscreen, median of 10) | 36 ms | < 1000 ms |
| Cold start, main() to first frame, X11 (Xvfb) | 36–52 ms | |
| Cold start, main() to first frame, native Wayland (weston headless) | 21–29 ms | |
| Open 1 MB, fully loaded | 179 ms | < 500 ms |
| Open 10 MB, first screen editable | 95 ms | < 2–3 s |
| Open 10 MB, fully loaded | 2.2 s | |
| Open 10 MB, styling finished in the background | 3.8 s | |
| Key to paint, small file (median / p95 / max) | 1.0 / 1.4 / 22 ms | ≤ 16 ms |
| Key to paint, 10 MB file (median / p95 / max) | 1.1 / 1.8 / 3.7 ms | ≤ 16 ms |
| Save 10 MB: UI thread blocked | 25 ms | imperceptible |
| Save 10 MB: total until written | 108 ms | |
| Binary size (stripped, Qt shared) | 310 KB | |

Core (Google Benchmark): decode 10 MB 24 ms, encode 10 MB 32 ms, render every line of 10 MB
21 ms, parse the built-in theme 8 µs, render one heading line 60 ns.

### Known gaps and next steps

- **Saving 10 MB blocks the UI for about 25 ms** (copying the text out of `QTextDocument`). Under
  1 MB this is below 3 ms. Options: copy in slices with the editor briefly read-only, or keep a
  copy-on-write snapshot. To be decided in S007's follow-up.
- **Loading and background styling of 10 MB are dominated by Qt** (inserting text into
  `QTextDocument` and relayouting styled blocks), not by the core (21 ms for all lines). The editor
  is usable after 95 ms, but read-only until the whole file is inserted (2.2 s here).
- Measurements on reference hardware with a real display (S011), including cold-cache starts.
